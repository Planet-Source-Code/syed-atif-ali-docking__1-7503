## Docking

### Description

This code shows you how to do docking or snapping (however you may like to call it). It has two docking styles -- one is with a timer and the other one is just a normal one. You can dock one form with the other, and you can also dock, any of the forms, with the screen ends.
 
### More Info
 
Just see it in the code.

OK. The forms dock to the screen ends and to each other. Simple?

All you need to know are mathematical skills (just a tiny bit) and imagination.

Docked windows. Duh!

With the timer, the docking looks crappy.
